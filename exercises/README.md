[Exercises are here](../exercises.md).

Use the directory structure

```
exercise_name/language_name/...
```

For example, `hello_world/scala` is the directory containing solutions to the "Hello World" exercise in the Scala language, using Scala's idiomatic directory structure (generated by `sbt`) within that directory.

If you have questions you can google, open an issue on this repository, or ask on the slack channel.
